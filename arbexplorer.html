        <a style="cursor: pointer" href="https://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">The Arnold Arboretum</a>
         is a cherised park in Boston that contains a vast collection of rare and beautiful trees. The park is free and open to the public, and offers a variety
         of online tools that let you explore the park from home. One of these tools is
         <a style="cursor: pointer" href="https://www.arboretum.harvard.edu/explorer/" target="_blank">the ArbExplorer.</a> While working on the 
         team I was tasked with developing a creative brief around reimagining what this tool could look like.

        <p>As it stands today, the ArbExplorer is a powerful tool living inside a dysfunctional body. 
            Some key features include being able to search through different plant collections, curate your own tour, 
            read about individual plants and their characteristics, and more. But unfortunately it doesn’t live up to its potential, 
            as it’s not a very user friendly system. It’s UI is outdated and overwhelming, hindering the user experience.</p>

    <h6>As a part of Upstatement’s redesign of the Arboretum website, we also wanted to show them what a new Explorer could look like. 
        My job was to create a design brief that would show research, findings, insights, and key design screens. </h6>

        <p>“The Arboretum is a unique park that offers a collection of trees that you can’t find anywhere else, 
            and the new ArbExplorer will be a platform that has unique capabilities that aren’t offered anywhere else. 
            A new interface would create a bridge between years worth of research and curious visitors. More broadly, 
            the main goal will be to help non-scientists learn and immerse themselves in the Arboretum experience from their home, 
            or from their phone.”
