    <p>In 1977, NASA attached two phonographic records to Voyager 1 and 2. Each record contains images and audio that were 
        carefully selected in order to portray the diversity of Life on Earth.  
        Currently, these records are floating in space, with intentions on one day being discovered by extraterrestrials. 
    </p>
    <p>Overtures is a virtual gallery that acts as an extension to these records, 
        using an ever-growing number of ordinary people. 
        The gallery aims to explore what is truly valuable and unique to humans, 
        on a personal and intimate level. All content that is gathered, whether personal, 
        political, or cultural, are collected under the idea of “what would you want 
        beings not from this Earth to know about us?”</p>

        <h5>Beginnings</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="texthalf">
        <p>I started this project by analyzing NASA’s Golden Records, and getting a good idea of their thought process and concept behind the records. 
            I learned that they were made by Carl Sagan and his small team of associates, who were all scientists.  
            Although I do think they were equipped to curate an objectively idealistic representation of Life on Earth, I think its impossible to truly represent 
            full diversity if only a handful of people are in charge of the process. So I wanted to open up this concept for participation from an ever-growing 
            number of individuals.</p>

<div class="pullquote">
    <h6>What if the concept of these Golden Records was extended to the public? What would it look like? What would be on them?</h6>

    <div class="texthalf">
        <p>Before knowing what the final deliverable of this project would look like, I began going around and asking strangers what they would add.
            This became a big part of my process, and I spent a few weeks going out into the public and talking to strangers and telling them about my project and asking them to participate. 
            Two big struggles with this process, was that it took a massive amount of time, and it was also very difficult getting genuine answers from people. 
            Understandably, it’s hard to open up to someone you just met. After getting a large amount of content from people willing to contribute, this brought me to a new question.</p>

<div class="pullquote">
    <h6>What do I do with all of this content? How can I create something that is engaging and informative?</h6>

        <h5>The Form</h5>
    </div>
    <div class="texthalf">
        <p>The final form of this project had to be one that worked well in displaying various kinds of content, 
            whether it be images, audio, songs, text, objects, etc. It had to be adaptable and able to show all of 
            these in a visually comprehensive and engaging way. Another requirement of my final form was that I wanted it to be something that wasn’t only in my possession. 
            I felt that the idea of creating something that was only able to be viewed by me was the antithesis to my concept and analysis of NASA’s Golden Records. 
            So I wanted to open up my project for as many people to explore it as possible. With all of this in mind, I came to the final idea of creating a virtual gallery.</p>

    <div class="texthalf">
        <p>The gallery is built in a digital 3D environment, giving users the ability to roam through it on their computer. 
            Bringing digital elements into a typical museum layout allowed me to add things such as directional UI, and locational audio to elevate a typical gallery walkthrough.

        <p>As a very conceptually driven project, there is a lot of work to be done around the evolution of its final form. How can I make this more accessible? 
            How can I make this more engaging? As I move forward with this project, these are the questions I will be trying to solve.
