                    In 1977, NASA attached two phonographic records to Voyager 1 and 2. 
                    Each record contains images and audio that were carefully selected in order 
                    to portray the diversity of Life on Earth. As my thesis project, Overtures was a virtual gallery that acts as an extension to these records.</p>
